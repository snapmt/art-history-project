# art-history-project
This is an art history project for Columbia Falls Junior High. 
Students will use HTML5 and CSS3 to build a static website.
The website will explain five facts about an artist and will also have a virtual gallery of the artist's important works.
Finally the students will also create a Works Cited page for their research and images.
